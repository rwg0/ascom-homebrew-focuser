# ascom-homebrew-focuser

Source code for a simple ASCOM Focuser driver that can be used with Homebrew USB/Serial adaptors as 
discussed on http://www.astronomyshed.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=63

In essence the hardware communication is via a serial port (real or USB) and the focuser moves
when data is sent to the port and direction is controlled via the RTS line.

To build you will require Visual Studio (2015, maybe 2013) and WIX (Windows Installer XML tools) too.
The free version of Visual Studio should be sufficient.
